# Project-1
First in my project I made a HammingDist class. The purpose of this class was to read the file given and to compare the
chars of the given cities. First I initialized variables for the first and second city, along with an ArrayList. 
I then made a bufferedreader in order to read in the file and I used a while loop to save the contents of the file into 
the hammingArray ArrayList.

I then created four different boolean objects that would compare each of the chars in the cities given and it would return
true if the two chars being compared were equal. Otherwise it would return false.
